## Resources

## Types

### Dataset



The Dataset API is used to describe data that can be referenced for training Models. 
 - Datasets pull in remote data sources using containerized data loaders. 
 - Users can specify their own ETL logic by referencing a repository from a Dataset. 
 - Users can leverage pre-built data loader integrations with various sources. 
 - Training typically requires a large dataset. The Dataset API pulls a dataset once and stores it in a bucket, which is mounted directly into training Jobs. 
 - The Dataset API allows users to query ready-to-use datasets (`kubectl get datasets`). 
 - The Dataset API allows Kubernetes RBAC to be applied as a mechanism for controlling access to data.

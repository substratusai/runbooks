# Substratus

Deploy and fine-tune large language models on K8s

[Substratus](https://www.substratus.ai) is a cross-cloud substrate for training
and serving ML models. It extends the Kubernetes control plane to orchestrate ML
operations through the addition of custom resource definitions: Model, Server,
Dataset, and Notebook.

Features:

* Deploy state-of-the-art ML models in minutes. We ❤️ open source LLMs.
* Fine-tune without writing code.
* Built-in serving layer compatible with OpenAI APIs.
* Run Notebooks to experiment. Ship an identical serving environment to production.

Our one-minute demo shows the basics:

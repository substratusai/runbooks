          for training Models. \n - Datasets pull in remote data sources using containerized
          data loaders. \n - Users can specify their own ETL logic by referencing
          a repository from a Dataset. \n - Users can leverage pre-built data loader
          integrations with various sources. \n - Training typically requires a large
          dataset. The Dataset API pulls a dataset once and stores it in a bucket,
          which is mounted directly into training Jobs. \n - The Dataset API allows
          users to query ready-to-use datasets (`kubectl get datasets`). \n - The
          Dataset API allows Kubernetes RBAC to be applied as a mechanism for controlling
          access to data."
